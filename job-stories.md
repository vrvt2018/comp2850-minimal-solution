1. When I add a task for something I have planned in the future, I want to be able to edit it later so I can amend it if there are any changes, as my plans often change and I like to keep on top of things.

2. When I am using my screen reader in the morning to check the day's tasks, I want all tasks to be read to me in order so I know my day's workload in advance, because I typically struggle to prepare for it.

3. When I am using my screen reader to read through my tasks, I want my tasks to be numbered so I know how many tasks I have as mentally counting tasks is difficult and it is easy to miscount when I have many tasks.
